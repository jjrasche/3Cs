# The Three Cs

**Connection. Consensus. Coordination.**

> The overhead of collaborating with others is the enemy of possibility.

## The Vision

**Collaboration is broken.**

Not because we lack tools—we're drowning in them. It's broken because **there's too much friction**.

Someone has to chase people for decisions. Someone has to manage the spreadsheet. Someone has to send the reminders. Or things just fall apart.

So we don't plan the trip. We don't start the project. We don't organize the event. Not because we don't want to—but because the **coordination work** makes it feel impossible.

**What if we could remove that friction?**

What if AI could reduce the overhead so groups can actually collaborate without someone carrying the burden?

Not by making decisions FOR us—but by **reducing friction** so we can make decisions TOGETHER.

## The Three Cs

Every collaboration requires solving three problems:

### 1. Connection — Finding People to Collaborate

The work of bringing people together is time-consuming:
- Your network is limited (Dunbar's number: ~50 people)
- Making connections requires social overhead
- Following up, finding the right moment, coordinating communication
- Information gets lost across platforms

**AI helps:** Know enough about you to connect you effectively. One link to join. Reliable communication (SMS when needed). Finding people who actually want to collaborate.

---

### 2. Consensus — Deciding What to Do

Creating the boundaries of collaboration: What are we doing? Why? How?

Making it inclusive enough but focused enough. Getting everyone's input without endless meetings.

**AI helps you diverge individually** (explore possibilities with a thinking partner)
**AI helps you converge collectively** (synthesize preferences, make every voice count)

This is about having one-on-one time with a thinking partner around the idea, then bringing those perspectives together.

---

### 3. Coordination — Making It Happen

The micro-decisions that enable the macro consensus. Resources: time, money, assets, social capital.

Who's doing what? When? With what? Keeping information in one place. The pre-planning that makes things go smoothly.

**AI makes it invisible:** Track everything. Automate logistics. Send reminders. Collect payments. Coordination happens without someone "running" it.

---

## The Promise

**Making human collaboration effortless.**

Enabling community through collaboration. Unlocking the possibilities we leave on the table because coordination feels too hard.

When organizing 100 people takes the same effort as organizing 5, we attempt things we never would have tried.

---

## The Approach

**AI as partner, not director.**
The system suggests, reminds, facilitates—but humans decide.

**Flexible structure.**
No templates. Collaboration shapes itself. User-defined, not predetermined.

**Emergent organization.**
Structure evolves with needs. System adapts to how groups actually work.

---

## How It Feels

Imagine planning a 30-person camping trip where:

- **Everyone contributes** (suggest ideas, vote on dates, sign up for tasks)
- **AI facilitates quietly** ("3 of 10 voted, gentle nudge sent")
- **Decisions emerge** (consensus without anyone "running" meetings)
- **Logistics happen** (who's bringing what, automatically tracked)

You never feel like the organizer. Nobody does. It just... *happens*.

## The Technology

MongoDB · Node.js · React · Groq AI · Docker

Built with E2E-first TDD. AI-augmented development. Progressive enhancement.

## Get Involved

This is early. Vision is clear, implementation is beginning.

We need people who believe collaboration can be better. Developers who want to build it. Groups willing to try it.

**Because when coordination is easy, possibility explodes.**

We can do more together—but not with this overhead, not with this friction.

That's what we're removing.
