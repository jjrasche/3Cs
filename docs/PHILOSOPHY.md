**The Three Cs Framework for Collaboration**

## The Three Cs Framework

Collaboration requires solving three fundamental problems:

1. **Connection** - Assembling the group (frictionless invites, viral growth)
2. **Consensus** - Collective decision-making (AI-mediated, transparent)
3. **Coordination** - Resource pooling (logistics, finances, time)

**Goal:** Reduce overhead in all three to near-zero, enabling groups to self-organize at scale.

## Key Principles

### Non-Hierarchical
Everyone contributes to the extent they want. No designated "organizer" who shoulders all responsibility.

### AI as Partner
The system facilitates and suggests, but doesn't dictate. AI augments human decision-making rather than replacing it.

### Flexible Structure
User-defined schema allows arbitrary nesting and custom data models. No rigid templates that force collaboration into predetermined shapes.

### Action Uniformity
AI and users call identical operations. No special AI backdoor - same permissions, same actions, same constraints.

### Emergent Organization
Structure evolves with collaboration needs. The system adapts to how groups actually work rather than forcing them into predefined workflows.

## Vision Statement

**"Make collaboration effortless by reducing coordination overhead to near-zero. Enable groups to self-organize at any scale."**

### 10-Year Horizon
Become the default tool for organizing any group activity requiring logistics, collective finance, or coordination:
- Community events
- Conference planning
- Group trips and retreats
- Family reunions
- Neighborhood projects
- Volunteer coordination
- Shared resource management

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Collaboration Tools
- Rigid templates (event planning, project management, etc.)
- Designated organizer who does most work
- Manual coordination (chasing people for decisions)
- Siloed functionality (separate tools for chat, polls, payments)

### The 3Cs Approach
- User-defined structure (collaboration shapes itself)
- Distributed responsibility (everyone contributes equally)
- AI-mediated coordination (system nudges, reminds, facilitates)
- Unified platform (everything in one collaborative object)

## Core Beliefs

**1. Coordination overhead is the enemy**
The harder it is to coordinate, the fewer things groups attempt. Reducing friction unlocks possibilities.

**2. Hierarchies emerge from tool limitations**
Someone becomes "the organizer" because tools don't distribute work well. Better tools enable true peer collaboration.

**3. AI should amplify human intent**
AI helps groups achieve what they want faster, not make decisions for them. Facilitation, not control.

**4. Structure should emerge, not be imposed**
Every collaboration is unique. Starting with templates forces compromises. Starting with flexibility enables authentic organization.

**5. Scale shouldn't increase burden**
Going from 5 to 50 to 500 people should require the same effort from each individual. AI handles the coordination complexity.

## Success Metrics

**Individual Level:**
- Time spent coordinating ↓ (AI handles it)
- Clarity on what's happening ↑ (transparent state)
- Satisfaction with outcome ↑ (everyone's input counts)

**Group Level:**
- Participation rate ↑ (easier to contribute)
- Decision velocity ↑ (less stuck in limbo)
- Successful completion ↑ (fewer abandoned plans)

**System Level:**
- Collaboration size scales without friction
- Diverse use cases emerge (not just planned ones)
- Viral growth through invites (Connection)

## Design Philosophy

### Start Simple, Stay Flexible
MVP focuses on core Three Cs. Advanced features emerge from real use cases, not speculation.

### Test-Driven Development
Features are proven to work through E2E tests before considered complete. Tests are the specification.

### AI-Augmented, Human-Decided
AI suggests, facilitates, and automates. Humans decide, approve, and validate. Clear boundary between assistance and agency.

### Progressive Enhancement
System works without AI (manual coordination). AI makes it better (automated coordination). But core functionality never depends on AI being "smart enough."
