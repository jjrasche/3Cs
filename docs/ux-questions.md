# UX Questions

Questions to resolve before building. Focus on what users actually see and do.

---

## Entry Points

- How does someone start a collaboration?
- How do they invite others?
- What's the first thing an invitee sees?

---

## The Extraction Conversation

- Is it chat-like? Form-like? Voice?
- How does the AI prompt for more depth (dig deeper)?
- When does it feel like enough?
- How do we avoid it feeling like therapy?

---

## Constraint Confirmation

- How do they see "here's what I extracted"?
- How do they edit/remove/add?
- How do they choose anonymous vs attributed?
- What's the visual treatment for the "did I get this right?" moment?

---

## Proposals and Consensus

- How do proposals appear?
- How do people respond (approve, modify, object)?
- What does "yeah that works" look like in UI?
- How is minority position engagement surfaced?

---

## Ongoing Coordination

- How do assignments appear?
- How does the AI communicate changes?
- What triggers escalation back to consensus?

---

## Profile and Returning Users

- How do they see their learned constraints?
- How is pre-population presented when joining new collaborations?
- Can they manage their profile explicitly?

---

## General

- Mobile-first or desktop-first?
- How much should feel like chat vs dashboard?
- Where does the AI feel invisible vs present?
