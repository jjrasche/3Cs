# 3Cs Project Context

## Project Overview
The Three Cs is a product concept focused on enabling effortless human collaboration by reducing coordination friction. The core thesis: we can do more together, for less, than individually—but high collaboration costs kill that possibility.

## Core Framework
- **Connection** — Finding and bringing people together
- **Consensus** — Deciding what to do collectively
- **Coordination** — Making it happen through micro-decisions and logistics

## Design Philosophy
- AI as partner, not director—suggests, reminds, facilitates; humans decide
- Flexible structure—collaboration shapes itself, user-defined
- Emergent organization—structure evolves with needs

## Working Style
This is primarily a conceptual and product strategy project. Prioritize:
- High-level product thinking over implementation details
- Human behavior and sociology perspectives
- Market dynamics and collaboration patterns
- Conceptual clarity and framework development

When discussing technical aspects, focus on architecture and system design rather than code specifics unless explicitly requested.

## Key Questions We're Exploring
- How do we reduce coordination costs to near-zero?
- What makes AI facilitation feel invisible rather than intrusive?
- How do we balance individual agency with collective momentum?
- What collaboration patterns emerge when friction disappears?
